# Problem Statement:
# Records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.



# Project Steps and Tools:

## **Step1:Importing Data From KAGGLE using Api Credentials Method **

  ### 𝘛𝘰𝘰𝘭𝘴: Python Script 
      Ensuring Data Automation updates using KAGGLE TOKENS , We run Python code every time we need to upload recent data from kaggle.
  
## **Step2:Data Cleaning & Transformation**

 ### 𝘛𝘰𝘰𝘭𝘴: 𝘔𝘪𝘤𝘳𝘰𝘴𝘰𝘧𝘵 𝘗𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘘𝘶𝘦𝘳𝘺

   Ensuring data accuracy and consistency was crucial. We cleaned and transformed the data, addressing NULL values and other anomalies. This phase was all about improving data quality and reliability.

## **Step3:𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴**

  ###𝘛𝘰𝘰𝘭𝘴: 𝘔𝘪𝘤𝘳𝘰𝘴𝘰𝘧𝘵 𝘗𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘉𝘐
  
   Designing a star schema to structure the data for optimal performance and ease of analysis was key. This modeling set the stage for effective and efficient reporting.

## **Step4: 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 & 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴**

  ###𝘛𝘰𝘰𝘭𝘴: 𝘔𝘪𝘤𝘳𝘰𝘴𝘰𝘧𝘵 𝘗𝘰𝘸𝘦𝘳 𝘉𝘐, 𝘋𝘈𝘟
  
    We created interactive dashboards and reports to visualize key metrics and provide actionable insights
    We focused on customer analysis, product performance, and overall business insights.
    DAX was our tool of choice for dynamic calculations and real-time data insights.
